# School-codes
These are my codes from school.
In the Java file is java codes from my time learning the ib syllabus.
In the Python file are horribly named phython projects from my time learning the IGCSE old cs syllabus.
I will only be updating the Java file from now on.
Feel free to copy my code, (its fine I dont mind).
